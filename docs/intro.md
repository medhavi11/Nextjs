# About Next.js

It is a React framework for production.

### How React lacks ?

- Not possible to build a full feature rich application ready to be deployed for production.

- React is only responsible for the view layer of the application, and we spend much time of other features like routing, styling , auth etc.

### Why Next.js ?

- It's a package that uses React for building user interfaces but it also comes loaded with lot more features that enable you to build full fledged production ready application.

- Loaded with features like routing, styling, auth, bundle optimization.

- No need to install additional packages.

- It simplifies the process of building a react application for production. **Some of the are listed below :**
  - File based routing - No need of thiord party routing package.
  - Pre-rendering - Generates html for each page in advance, instead of having it all done by client side javascript. This results in better performance and _SEO_
  - API routes - Might come as a surprise but you can actually create APIs using next.js.
  - Supports CSS modules - Saves you the time of choosing a CSS library.
